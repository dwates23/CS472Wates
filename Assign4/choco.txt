For this algorithm, we need to take these steps:
-think of the chocolate bar as a rectangle with the height and width of n x m.
-find out which is bigger? n or m? 
-cut the bar along the longer side, which will split the chocolate bar in two smaller rectangles.
-repeat the previous 2 steps until the chocolate bar pieces measure out to 1 x 1.
-finally, the amount of cuts made will be counted. This amount represents the minimum number of breaks needed for the bar.

The root of the tree can be see as the chocolate bar before breaks are made. Every level of the tree can
be seen as the chocolate bar after the breaks were made. One way this algorithm finds the minimum amount 
of bar breaks for the chocolate is through the greedy strategy. The algorithm will always make cuts along
the longer side of the bar the way it is at the time. Each break divides what is left of the chocolate bar
into the largest piece which minimizes the amount of breaks needed to reduce the chocolate bar to 1 x 1.
